# Introduction_to_AJAX
Starting my journey into the world of AJAX.

A website which helps people moving to a new location by fetching useful articles from New York Times, as well as
showing Wikipedia links for relevant nearby places. It sets background to new place using Google StreetView.

I learned JSON parsing, and interacting with different API's making use of their web services in my site using AJAX i.e
'Asynchronous JavaScript and XML' and explored jQuery utlizing it's robust and simpler API.

Please enter street address and city details correctly for best results.
